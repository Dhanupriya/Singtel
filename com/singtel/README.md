I have used abstract factory pattern to solve this test.
Solution.java is the main file from which you can run and check the output.


Solution.java uses AnimalFactoryProducer to produce the AnimalFactory of bird/swim/changing behavior .
From the animal factory optained one can call the different methods like "fly"/swim/sing/walk.

I have answred A,B,C,D,E and first part of bonus question.

Rest service & unit testing I couldnt complete due to lack of time.
But know how to do.
